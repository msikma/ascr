**A script that downloads artwork from websites for personal archiving**

Currently, this script can scrape images from Twitter, Tumblr and Pixiv. It can't get videos from Twitter or Tumblr (you should use [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) for that), but it does convert Pixiv animations into either .gif or .webm.

![Ascr example](https://i.imgur.com/WzbaHIg.png)

I've tried to make this tool as convenient as possible. Images are always downloaded in the highest possible quality. If a post is a thread, the rest of the author's images are downloaded as well. Names are autogenerated as much as possible.

As far as I'm aware this is the only tool that can generate GIFs/WebM files from Pixiv animations.

## Installation

You can install Ascr using npm:

```
npm i -g ascr
```

That's it.

## Usage

Just type `ascr "http://site.com/url/to/post"` and the images found there will be downloaded to your current directory.

You might want to append `--name "enter a cool name here"` for the filename. (Tumblr and Pixiv have autogenerated default names.)

### All options

```
usage: ascr [-h] [-v] [-q] [--name NAME] [--author AUTHOR] [--cookies COOKIES]
            [--subset SUBSET] [--dir-min DIRMIN] [--author-dir] [--overwrite]
            [--raw-data] [--only-data] [--anim TYPE] [--no-thread] [--inline]
            [url [url ...]]

Art Scraper - downloads artwork from websites for personal archiving.

This program will visit the URL given and download the image found there.
Currently supported URL schemes:
  Pixiv:   e.g. https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=12345678
  Twitter: e.g. https://twitter.com/username/status/12345678910111213
  Tumblr:  e.g. https://username.tumblr.com/post/12345678910/post-title

To download images that are behind a login wall (e.g. posts by protected
accounts or R-18 images), you need to set up a cookies.txt file containing
the session cookies from your browser.

See https://github.com/msikma/ascr for information on how to do this.

Positional arguments:
  url                URL(s) to scrape and download files from.

Optional arguments:
  -h, --help         Show this help message and exit.
  -v, --version      Show program's version number and exit.
  -q, --quiet        Only output filenames. Pass -qq to fully silence output.
  --name NAME        Name to give the files (autodetected for some sources).
  --author AUTHOR    Override the name of the author.
  --cookies COOKIES  Location of the cookies.txt file.
  --subset SUBSET    Get a subset of the item's images. Can be a single value 
                     (e.g. 4), range (e.g. 1-6) or sequence (e.g. 2,4,7-9).
  --dir-min DIRMIN   Minimum number of images needed to make a directory. (5) 
                     Set to 0 to never make a directory.
  --author-dir       If making a directory, make one of the author's name too.
  --overwrite        Overwrite files if they exist instead of renaming.
  --raw-data         Instead of displaying an information table, display raw 
                     data extracted from the page.
  --only-data        Display information without downloading files.
  --anim TYPE        Pixiv: sets the type of animation we will generate when 
                     downloading an animated work: gif, webm, none. (gif)
  --no-thread        Twitter: download only the original tweet's images 
                     instead of the whole thread.
  --inline           Tumblr: include inline images found in the caption HTML.

Please always respect the artists' copyright and their wishes regarding the 
sharing of their work.

## Support for other sites

I have no plans to add support for other sites at the moment, but PRs are always welcome (as is all other feedback!)

## Animations

Some Pixiv works are animations. Ascr can convert these to .gif or .webm, but you'll need [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) to do it. To make WebM files, your ffmpeg build needs to have LibVPX support.

The easiest way to install ffmpeg on Mac OS X is by using [Brew](https://brew.sh/):

    brew install ffmpeg --with-libvpx

If you're making your own build, make sure to get `libvpx-dev` and compile with `--enable-libvpx`.

## Using a `cookies.txt` file

You'll likely want to set up a cookies file in order to make logged in requests. Pixiv images are in lower resolution to users who aren't logged in, and some images will not be visible to guests (for example, images from a private Twitter account).

To do this, you need to log in using your browser and then copy the login cookies to a file to use with Ascr.

If you use Chrome, you might want to try the [cookies.txt extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/njabckikapfpffapmjgojcnbfjonfjfg) which lets you copy your cookies into the correct format. The [youtube-dl documentation](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-youtube-dl) also has a primer on how to obtain your cookies file.

Cookies should be placed in `~/.config/ascr/cookies.txt`. Alternatively, you can pass `--cookies path/to/cookies.txt` as an argument, or set the `ASCR_COOKIE_FILE` environment variable to the file's path. Ascr will update your cookies file if it receives updates from the server.
